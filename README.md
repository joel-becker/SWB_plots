# SWB_plots
Plotting functions for many-layered plots (for a subjective well-being paper).

## Purpose of functions
Ori Heffetz and Daniel Benjamin wanted the following 'non-trivial features':

> 8 different patterns, legends, more than one axis in Panel (C), combining 9 mini-graphs to a single figure with titles at the different levels, etc

The functions in `plots.R` allow for flexible production of a series of plots with the above characteristics.

## End result
As currently written, the functions are combined to produce the following plot:
