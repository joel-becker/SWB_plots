# SWB_plots
This repo contains plotting functions for many-layered plots.

(The immediate purpose of these plots was use in a behavioural economics paper, but they are flexible enough to be useful more broadly.)

## Purpose of functions
Professors Heffetz and Benjamin wanted the following 'non-trivial features':

> 8 different patterns, legends, more than one axis in Panel (C), combining 9 mini-graphs to a single figure with titles at the different levels, etc

The functions in `plots.R` allow for flexible production of a series of plots with the above characteristics.

## End result
As currently written, the functions combine to produce the following plot:
